    "text": "Image produced by DreamStudio\nTo help me get started developing a training resource for reproducible MATLAB, I began with surveying researchers who use it to find out what they know already, what they‚Äôd like to know and how they‚Äôd like to learn things. I have some advantage and some disadvantage here, at least for the time-being, as a former researcher who got their start through MATLAB, I have some idea of the level of knowledge and the concerns that researchers have. However, I‚Äôm only a sample size of one and I‚Äôve also been acting as a research software engineer for a few years, so I needed to get out of my bubble, and what better way to do that than with graphs üòÅ.\nYou can see the questions I asked and the contents of the survey alongside the data, analysis and results at the survey‚Äôs repository. Naturally, it was important the survey‚Äôs analysis itself was reproducible, so the code can be downloaded and hopefully run reproducibly. The full analysis can be seen here."

    "text": "Who was surveyed?\nThe survey was circulated via social media (e.g Twitter, Mastodon) and by a few mailing lists via research software engineers contacted through the RSE Society slack. At the University of Sheffield, where I work, it was also sent out to all users of MATLAB. These were chosen deliberately to target users in a university research setting. We can see from the raw data that the vast majority of respondents were based at academic research institutions, most of which were universities. There were no responses that needed to be removed as a result of being outside of this target group. One caveat is that, without targeting more user groups consisting of all MATLAB users, many of the respondents may have been likely to be more expert than a representative sample by being on RSE mailing lists, following RSEs on social media etc. However, as you‚Äôll see, we collected self-perceived experience levels, allowing the data to be categorised on that basis.\nTo start with, I asked the respondents to indicate their self-perceived level of expertise with MATLAB, and with programming in general. Let‚Äôs divide this up according to their reported career stage, note that it was possible for respondents to select multiple career stages."

    "section": "What‚Äôs the current situation?",
    "text": "What‚Äôs the current situation?\nNow we can get into the questions that provide more insight that will be relevant to my training course. Firstly, I wanted to know what tools are currently used with MATLAB when it comes to ‚Äúgood practice‚Äù and reproducible development.\n\nVersion control/source code management\nVersion control (or source code management) is an exceptionally valuable tool in any development of code. I wanted to know how likely our respondents were to use source code management tools such as git as well as online hosting and collaboration platforms such as GitHub. Additionally, I was interested to see whether there would be a difference in usage when it comes to working in MATLAB versus other languages.\nFor this and the next few questions, I asked participants to respond ‚ÄúNot aware of‚Äù, ‚ÄúAware of but don‚Äôt use‚Äù, ‚ÄúAware of and use with MATLAB‚Äù, ‚ÄúAware of and use outside MATLAB‚Äù, and they could choose more than one if they wanted to. In the analysis I‚Äôve derived another classification ‚ÄúUse outside but not with MATLAB‚Äù which is what it sounds like.\n\nWithout doing some statistical analysis, it is of course diffcult to draw precise conclusions, but let‚Äôs treat the findings qualatively. (Note that if you want to do some stats here, you can contribute back to this repository via a pull request on GitHub).\nFor this question, I was pleasantly surprised to see that ~90% of respondents were aware of version control, higher than perhaps I might have expected, though our survey respondents may have been a slightly self-selected population. What‚Äôs particularly interesting to me here is the ~25% who use version control outside of MATLAB, but not with it. Depending on whether participants interpreted the ‚ÄòUse outside MATLAB‚Äô and ‚ÄòUse outside but not with MATLAB‚Äô as being equivalent or not (that‚Äôs a lesson for me on study design!), this could be seen to be as high as ~50%. Without digging further into why the ‚ÄúAware of but don‚Äôt use‚Äù group responded that way, we can‚Äôt tell why, but we may be able to conclude that out of this group of 239 MATLAB users, up to around 75% don‚Äôt use version control when working with MATLAB, despite most being aware of it.\nAdditionally, we asked respondents to let us know which method they use to interact with git. There are lots of clients to use, including command-line and various graphical types, including the interface in the MATLAB IDE itself.\nImmediately we can see that the biggest group here are those who choose not to use git with MATLAB at all. (I haven‚Äôt analysed how many of this group don‚Äôt use git at all, though you could contribute that analysis via a pull request üòÅ)\nOut of those who use git when working with MATLAB there‚Äôs a fairly even spread across the interfaces mentioned including the native git command line interface, tools in other IDEs such as VScode or pycharm, GUIs such as GitHub Desktop or GitKraken client, and a fairly good chunk of users who do use the tools built into MATLAB itself. It‚Äôs worth pointing out here that the git integration in the GUI seems to have some nice impovements in the new MATLAB IDE launched recently in R2023a.\n\nNext, let‚Äôs take a look at GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket.\n\nStraight away, we can see that there‚Äôs an increase in awareness in relation to the version control tools themselves, more participants are aware of GitHub than they are of git, which might be a lesson to those of us who support researchers. Otherwise the pattern is broadly similar here, only 20% use GitHub when working with MATLAB.\n\n\nDependency and Environment Management\nWhen it comes to reproducibility, managing dependencies and environment - i.e.¬†the software that your code relies upon to run - is the fundamental challenge. It‚Äôs not an easy thing to do, but once you do, it can allow you to run your code almost anywhere. In many ways this is the crux of reproducibility of research analysis.\nFor MATLAB, I found this a particularly difficult question to pose, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve done the best job. Participants were asked to indicate their level of awareness and use of ‚ÄúDependency and/or environment management (e.g.¬†conda, renv, etc.)‚Äù which gives the examples conda and renv - common environment management tools in python and R respectively. However, to my knowledge, MATLAB doesn‚Äôt have equivalent tools. The closest is perhaps the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù, which we‚Äôll investigate further later on.\n\nHere, it looks like most (if not all) of those participants who use these tools outside MATLAB, might not use them with MATLAB, but perhaps this is because conda and renv aren‚Äôt relevant and participants were left to themselves to work out what dependency and environment managment looks like in MATLAB. However, some respondents do use these tools with MATLAB apparently, so I‚Äôm unsure what conclusion to draw here - possibly that I posed the question poorly. Either way, it looks like a fairly small number use dependency or environment management with MATLAB, through lack of availability of tools or awareness of the concepts.\nWe also asked similar questions about continuous integration, testing and literate programming, which you can see the results for here."

The other tools such as projects, source control, testing and custom toolbox development, see less use by this group, but still a fairly good proportion at around 20%.\nThese are some of the tools that I consider to be ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù, so it‚Äôs great to see that there is some adoption by researchers."

    "text": "Demand for training\nImportantly, I wanted to find out what the relative demand for learning some of these concepts and tools might be, as well as the training formats preferred.\nAcross the topics asked about (Projects, testing, live scripts, version control, toolbox development, publication and licensing) there was a consistent demand for training of around 25-30% of participants indicating some kind of demand. The preference for structured training versus self-guided learning varied between topics, with some of the perhaps more difficult topics leaning more strongly towards structured training, though there was a substantial demand for both for every topic. This is something I was keen to know about with regards to whether when developing materials one should consider the different demands of these two formats.\n\nThere aren‚Äôt any particularly stark findings here, the message seems to be that there‚Äôs a mixed bag of attitudes towards demand for training in these areas with no striking spikes or absences.\nInterestingly though, when it comes to software licensing, in comparison to the other topics asked about here, there was a rise in lack of interest for training, but a drop in those participants who were already familiar with the topic. When it comes to reproducibility and open research, licensing is what legally allows other people to use your code, so whilst the participants indicated a lack of demand for training here, I might suggest that this result indicates a greater need for it."

Which is great because that‚Äôs just what we‚Äôre producing! Ironically for this blog, it seems that the least popular source of training material was the blog and that more interactive formats are preferred, go figure!\nWhen it comes to subject matter, as mentioned above, I may add some more training on licensing than originally planned, or at least some general guidance, though since this is a topic that‚Äôs decoupled from MATLAB itself, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be within the MATLAB reproducibility resource that‚Äôs under development."

The most basic version of this is that by following the same methods of the researchers who originally performed a piece of work, you should be able to get to the same conclusions. This is essentially the concept of reproducibility, research should be able to be reproduced in order to validate its conclusions.\nWhen it comes to research code, it should be relatively easy to reproduce, right? There are no complicated experiments to run again, or data to collect, so it should be a given, shouldn‚Äôt it?\nIn practice, we find that exact versions of software dependencies or the toolboxes required are not documented alongside a project, or it isn‚Äôt even clear how to get the right data into the software or run the code at all. This means that even with the original code available to you, it might not be possible to run the code, or worse, it could produce incorrect results.\nThe goal of crafting a reproducible software project should be to produce a compendium of code, data and documentation that anyone should be able to pick up and run, generating the same results that you did initially. Reproducible software development practices are also just good practice in general, if you‚Äôve followed good practice in the first place, when you come back to a project in several months‚Äô or years‚Äô time (or just on Monday morning), you should be able to make improvements, re-run the code or validate your results."

    "text": "How to write reproducible MATLAB?\nHere are some tools and concepts you can use to improve the reproducibility of your MATLAB project. Many are the same concepts you‚Äôll find recommended for most research software (and most software) projects, with some specific guidance on how to implement these in MATLAB.\n\nCoding style\nWriting code that is readable should be your very first port of call for reproducibility. Not just for your colleagues and collaborators, but for yourself.\nIn brief, you should:\n\nInclude comments that explain what your code is doing,\nUse self-explanatory variable, function and class names,\nWrite modular code. Each function, for instance, should just do one job and be reusable at other places in your code,\nAvoid duplication. Write the code that does one job just once and write a function that you can call.\n\nA useful online resource for MATLAB coding style is the MATLAB Programming Style Guide, based on Richard Johnson‚Äôs book, The Elements of MATLAB style, also available on MATLAB‚Äôs FileExchange. Why not have a skim through this succinct resource before starting your next project?\n\n\nProject organisation\nThe first thing that makes a project difficult to reproduce is when you open the project folder to find a big heap of confusingly named scripts.\nUse folders/directories to organise your project, so that it is obvious (to you and anyone else who uses your code) where to find what is needed.\nAt the very top level of your project, why not have something like the following structure?\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/             # directory to contain your data\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/          # all your raw, unprocessed data\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/    # any data that you have altered\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ figures/          # keep the figures that you produce from your code here\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/          # a clear folder for your papers or reports for the project\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/              # source code\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ @MyClass/     # a class directory\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ a_module/     # a directory containing a group of functions or classes with some commonality\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/        # a directory containing utility functions\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/             # documentation\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/            # software tests for the project\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README            # readme file! (essential)\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my.prj            # MATLAB project file (read on for more details)\nFor more in depth guidance on how to organise a project (and loads of other excellent advice) check out the BES‚Äô guide to Reproducible Code - I still refer to this guide regularly.\n\n\nDocumentation\nYour users (that includes you) will thank you when they encounter some actual guidance on how to use your code - maybe they‚Äôll actually use it! Imagine that!\nIt‚Äôs a great idea to version control your documentation alongside your project (see version control section below) so that it remains up to date with changes in your code and the two don‚Äôt get out of sync with each other.\nTherefore, you need to write your documentation in a format that can be handled by your version control system (most likely, git) - e.g.¬†as text files, and not a PDF, word document or google doc. A number of tools exist for doing this outside of MATLAB, be it read the docs, roxygen2 or another documentation generator. You could even just write your documentation in LaTeX and combine with a tool to automatically render a pdf (see CI/CD below).\nOf course, you can use these tools for your MATLAB project. Your documentation is written in a raw text format such as markdown (like this blog post), or reStructuredText, MATLAB itself isn‚Äôt being used to execute code in the documentation. A documentation generator will process your raw text into a nice PDF or webpage. You could even run your documentation generator just using a continuous deployment tool such as github actions and never install or run the tool on your local machine at all!\nSee this MATLAB Answers thread for a few examples of documentation generators to use with MATLAB.\nHowever, if you want to work purely in MATLAB, it has the tools to generate HTML or PDF (or even powerpoint) from an m-file, which can be version controlled alongside your code.\n\nGenerating documentation with MATLAB\nThe tools for generating documentation from MATLAB are relatively immature, however there are plenty of functions available as part of the MATLAB Report Generator which you can use for building documentation.\nTake, for example, a file called docs.m which uses the MATLAB markup syntax to format some documentation.\n%% My User Documentation\n\n%% Section 1: Writing some text\n\n%%\n% One space after the comment symbol (|%|) renders some ordinary text.\n%\n%  Whereas two spaces creates a monospaced font output.\n%\n% Three spaces between the |%| and text outputs syntax highlighted code:\n%\n%\n%   for i = 1:10\n%       disp(x)\n%   end\n%\n% You can format _bold_, *italic* and |monospaced| inline as well.\nTry copying this code into a new m-file now. You can then publish your new documentation to an HTML file or PDF from the Publish tab in MATLAB:\n\n\n\nOn the Publish tab, go to publish\n\n\nClicking the down arrow opens a menu, with the bottom option being Edit publishing options... where you can edit the publishing options on a per-file basis. You can choose to output HTML, PDF, latex or XML as well as edit a number of other options.\nIf you output to PDF, you‚Äôll get some output that looks like this:\n\n\n\nPDF rendered output\n\n\nYou can also publish programmatically, using the publish function (documentation here)\noptions = struct('format', 'pdf', 'outputDir', 'docs');\npublish(\"docs.m\", options);\nWhilst not shown here, these files can contain executable code, see this blog article for an example, and there are many other tools for generating reports and documents from within MATLAB.\n\n\n\nVersion control\nVersion control is far more than these two words suggest, and enables a far more secure, dynamic and collaborative approach to developing code than without it. Of course, this is far more wide-ranging than just MATLAB, and as RSEs our first recommendation to researchers is to employ a version control system if they don‚Äôt already. Spending time learning how to use git, for instance, will pay dividends.\n\nWhy use version control?\nA version control system (VCS) allows you to capture snapshots of your code as you develop, meaning that you can go back if you want to. Furthermore, you can create branches to try out new ideas without fear of breaking your existing code - your main branch is still there! All this without making numerous copies and archives of your code. A VCS also allows you to merge one branch into another; so when you‚Äôre happy with your feature branch (where you try out a new idea), you can combine it with your main branch!\nUsing a VCS simply for developing code on your own machine is a great idea. But online platforms such as GitHub and GitLab add a host of excellent tools to facilitate collaboration, project management and distribution of your code.\n\n\nWhich version control system?\nAt the time of writing, there is one answer to this question, namely git. Originally developed in 2006, git has become the de facto standard VCS and for many developers is synonymous with the concept. As a researcher you may, however, come across older codebases controlled with other systems such as Subversion (SVN) or Mercurial, but git is the way to go for new projects at present.\n\n\nHow?\nThis is the one point here in which I can not currently (April 2022, MATLAB release R2022a) recommend the tools provided within MATLAB and would advise alternatives for version control. It may be that MathWorks will put out some improvements in the future, at which time I‚Äôll aim to revise this post.\nFar better (and free) alternatives to MATLAB‚Äôs tools exist for interacting with git, my current favourite is the GitKraken Client - it provides a great user interface with access to most (if not all) of the major operations you‚Äôre likely to want to do both with git and GitHub (or GitLab, BitBucket or Azure DevOps). Not to mention it has a great name. Helpfully, most of the terminology used (pull, fetch, rebase, fork, clone) comes from the core tools (git & GitHub) themselves, so anything you learn can generalise to other tools.\nIt would be irresponsible to attempt to provide instruction on using git here and there are many resources to learn from, not least the courses run by RSE teams!\n\n\n\nTesting\nSoftware testing means writing code that checks that your code is doing its job correctly. Most languages have a method for doing this and it‚Äôs an excellent habit to get into.\nAt first, stopping to write a test may seem like a hinderance, however you‚Äôll soon find that an automated check to your code will save you time and confusion in the long-run.\nLet‚Äôs have a look at writing some simple tests in MATLAB, so you can see what I mean.\n\nScript-based ‚Äòtesting‚Äô\nIdeally your code should be organised into functions and/or classes, however it is possible to do some level of validation with scripts, by using the assert function. assert checks a condition and throws an error if the condition is false, asserting that the condition is true.\nFor example (from the assert documentation)\nminVal = 7;\nx = 26;\n\nassert(minVal &lt; x)\nwill throw an error if minVal is greater than x.\nYou can use these throughout your scripts to check for some sources of errors and use any condition that returns a logical such as isa() to check a variable‚Äôs type or size to check the dimensions of an array.\nassert can also take a string argument as a message to print if the condition is not met.\nassert(minVal &lt; x, 'value is not greater than minVal')\nFor information on script-based unit testing in MATLAB, see the official docs here\n\n\nFunction-based testing\nIf your code is organised into functions (and/or classes), you can use the function-based and class-based testing frameworks to test those functions with a test suite. The function-based testing framework is a little simpler, but a big improvement on the use of assert above.\nTypes of test can briefly be categorised as:\n\nUnit tests - test individual ‚Äòunits‚Äô of code, most often a function.\nIntegration tests - test the operation of multiple units integrated together.\nRegression tests - test that the overall operation of the code is not damaged by new changes, in other words, that the code has not regressed.\n\nFor a simple example of a unit test, let‚Äôs say you have a function called add which adds together two values and returns the result that looks like this:\nfunction result = add(a,b)\n  result = a + b;\nend\nGenerally, you might have a folder in your project called tests, inside which you put a file called, for instance, test_add.m with the contents:\n%% Main function to generate tests - you don't need to change this\nfunction tests = exampleTest\ntests = functiontests(localfunctions);\nend\n\n%% Test Functions\nfunction test_add(testCase)\n  a = 1;\n  b = 2;\n  actual_result = add(a,b);\n  expected_result = a + b;\n  verifyEqual(testCase, actual_result, expected_result)\nend\nSimilarly to what we saw above, an error will be raised if the wrong result is produced. However in this case, rather than running as part of your main code, this test suite is run during development when making changes to verify that everything is still working as expected. (Perhaps as part of continuous integration below).\nWe can run all of our tests for a project from the MATLAB desktop under the Editor tab, including running tests with the debugger.\n\n\n\nNext steps in testing\nAs mentioned above, MATLAB provides more featureful tools for testing under the class-based testing framework; tools for testing applications and more. I may put together a blog post on these in the future.\n\n\n\nLicensing/open source\nIt is a common misconception that MATLAB code can not be released as open source because MATLAB itself is a proprietary language. This is not the case at all, just look at MATLAB‚Äôs File Exchange to see thousands of examples of users sharing their code.\nSoftware licensing is perhaps too big a discussion to be a subsection of a blog post, but the takeaway points here should be:\n\nRelease your code publicly, let others use it and cite your research and build upon it, have a bigger impact on the research community,\nIf you do not include a license at all, nobody can legally use your code, include a license that permits the kind of use that you want to, check out https://choosealicense.com/ to help you pick one,\n\n\n\nCollaborative hosting/GitHub/GitLab\nHosting your code on an online hosting platform such as GitHub or GitLab brings a tremendous number of benefits, including (but not limited to):\n\nActing as a reliable, remote backup,\nFacilitating collaboration and sharing of code,\nA plethora of project management tools alongside your code, making it easier to keep track of what work needs doing,\nPublic hosting of your code, making it easier to share,\nContinuous Integration/Deployment tools (e.g.¬†GitHub Actions) which, for instance, can be used to render documentation, run tests and many more things,\n\nWhilst not difficult to learn, there is too much to cover here, but in essence the basic process is:\n\nStart a new repository on GitHub,\nPush your local repository (version controlled by git) to the remote on GitHub,\nMake changes on a new branch locally and push them to GitHub,\nOpen a pull request to discuss merging your branch into the main one,\nMerge the changes,\nLocally, pull the new changes on the main branch,\nContinue working with the new changes and repeat!\n\n\n\nMATLAB ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù\nSince R2019a, MATLAB has included the Projects tool with the goal of improving collaboration and portability. Have you ever been sent code by a colleague and found that you can‚Äôt run it at all because you‚Äôre missing a bunch of dependent toolboxes and functions? This is one of the problems that Projects attempt to solve.\nBy creating a Project and adding all the relevant files needed to run the code, you should be able to pass on the code and project file (.prj) to someone else; they can open the Project and all the right files will be added to the path, any particular actions that you specify can be run, among other actions.\nProjects also allow you to run a dependency analysis, to report which other code yours depends on, and therefore needs to be considered for reproducibility.\nRemember! include your .prj file under version control.\n\n\nContinuous integration and continuous deployment\nThese might sound pretty scary, but all I really mean is: ‚Äúactions that run automatically‚Äù, maybe when you make changes to your code, or on a particular schedule for instance. These can do things such as running tests or updating the documentation. There are lots of tools for this such as Travis, CircleCI, Jenkins etc. but here I‚Äôm going to concentrate on GitHub Actions because it‚Äôs an increasingly popular tool and one that I‚Äôve used with MATLAB myself.\nIn brief, GitHub actions is a really, really, really useful tool! Some examples of things I‚Äôve done with actions when using MATLAB are: running tests when a pull request is made so that we can see that the new code works and doesn‚Äôt break anything before we merge it; automatically compiling a standalone application and an installer for any new releases; and at the same time publishing a PDF of user documentation and uploading it to the project‚Äôs release page automatically.\nMathWorks have made a number of actions available for use on GitHub under the matlab-actions organisation, for an overview, see this repo.\nTo learn more about GitHub actions, have a look at this learning resource. Basically all you have to do is include a .yml file in the .github/workflows/ folder of your project hosted on GitHub.\nThe actions available for MATLAB at present are reasonably limited, but versatile, at the moment they‚Äôre available to:\n\nRun Tests - to automatically run a test suite, and\nRun a MATLAB command - which allows you to do anything you can write the MATLAB code for, for instance:\n\nyou could run MATLAB‚Äôs checkcode function against the repo to look for problems in the code so you don‚Äôt have to look for them manually,\nor publish your [documentation][#Documentation] as HTML and use it to make a GitHub pages website containing docs for your code,\nor when a new release is made, build and share your toolbox to the MATLAB file exchange!\n\n\nYou can also combine these with one of the many actions from the GitHub actions marketplace even further extending the possibilities!\nThese MATLAB-specific actions can be run on GitHub actions‚Äô cloud computing for free for public projects hosted on GitHub (just another reason to go open source! üòÄ), but if your project is private, you can still use GitHub actions by setting up a self-hosted runner on your own computing infrastructure, I used a VM hosted by my university to do this for a private project. Note that other actions can be run on GitHub for private repos, but private projects only get a limited amount of free time per month.\n\n\nCompiling standalone applications\nOne way to solve the challenge of getting your code to run on other people‚Äôs computers, particularly if they don‚Äôt have a MATLAB license, is to consider building your code as a standalone application. This takes your MATLAB source code and bundles it in such a way that it can be run on a machine without a MATLAB license, and without MATLAB installed - helpful in a number of situations.\nThis can be achieved through point and click menus or, better yet, by writing a script to run that runs the build operation.\nNote the application must be built for each operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux etc) and generally the build process must be run on a compatible operating system. For instance, if you want to build your program to run on Windows, the build command should be run from within MATLAB on Windows.\nThis is a useful tool, for instance if you want to run analysis on a machine without MATLAB installed - but isn‚Äôt a complete solution to reproducibility, and openly sharing your source code should be the first thing you think of, in my opinion.\n\n\nPublishing your code with a research paper\nOnce you‚Äôve done all this, how do we get to the business of actually publishing code alongside our research?! Well fortunately, everything is fairly straightforward from this point!\nThe first thing I‚Äôd recommend is asking a friend or colleague to attempt to reproduce your results following the instructions provided in your online repository. Remember to document where to get your data from! You could even consider submitting your work to a reprohack event! Essentially, this process of getting someone else who doesn‚Äôt know about the code to try and run it and get the same results should highlight gaps in your documentation, allowing you to fix them before sending your code out to the world.\nBy hosting your code on a public repository with a tool like GitHub, you‚Äôll be able to link to the code as it was at the time of submission. At this stage, I‚Äôd recommend creating a tag to indicate the commit that the repository was at when you produced the final results. On GitHub, you can alternatively create a ‚Äòrelease‚Äô. You can just use a version number and quote this in the description of your methods.\nFurthermore, it‚Äôs possible to use Zenodo to create a DOI for your GitHub release so that there is a persistent identifier for that version of the codebase.\n\n\nAnd finally‚Ä¶\nJust try your best! Most researchers still don‚Äôt publish their code and very few projects are reproducible, so anything you can do to improve your work will get you closer.\nIf you want to discuss how to make your code more reproducible and don‚Äôt know what to do, book a code clinic with the RSE and Research IT teams at The University of Sheffield to see how we can help!"

    "text": "Image produced by Stable Diffusion\nOne of the major criticisms of MATLAB from a reproducibility standpoint relates to running MATLAB itself. For one thing, MATLAB is proprietary product requiring a license (see my last blog for more on this) - presenting an expensive reroducibility hurdle. Moreover, MATLAB can be a chore to install. Unlike python for instance, where the core language library is fairly quick to install, MATLAB comes bundled with the IDE among other things and can be over a gigabyte, making it unappealing to install to test out running someone else‚Äôs code or to install a different version.\nWorry no more, reproducibility fans! MathWorks have got our backs.\nAs detailed on Mike Croucher‚Äôs post on the MATLAB blog, it is now possible to create a link that will open a MATLAB GitHub repository to be run on MATLAB Online - without a license!\nYou may have heard of the Binder project, which has been around for a few years now, facilitating reproducible ephemeral compute environments (for python, Julia or R) in the cloud. Binder will fetch the contents of a public repo, build a docker image and spin up a compute environment in the browser.\nWell now we have that for MATLAB! And it‚Äôs super simple.\nLet‚Äôs say your code was on github at: github.com/reproducibleMATLAB/temperature-visualisations\nAll you have to do is create a link: https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=reproducibleMATLAB/temperature-visualisations\nYou can even add project files and a default starting file to your link: https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=reproducibleMATLAB/temperature-visualisations&project=temperature_visualisations.prj&file=temperature_visualisations.mlx\nThese mean that you can control the dependencies and even include files that run on project startup. I‚Äôve used one of these in this project to check that a required toolbox is installed and to warn the user if not.\nThere‚Äôs even a handy online tool for creating these links for you.\nYou can use it to create a link for adding a badge to your repo:\n[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=reproducibleMATLAB/temperature-visualisations&project=temperature_visualisations.prj&file=temperature_visualisations.mlx)\n\n\n\nOpen in MATLAB Online\n\n\nThis is a great step forward for reproducibility in MATLAB, now we can make it easy for anyone to open a MATLAB project and run it in the cloud, even if they don‚Äôt have a license. All they need is a MathWorks account and they can use the basic tier of MATLAB online for free."

    "text": "Image produced by Stable Diffusion\nMATLAB is a proprietary language and software. It is a product, produced by MathWorks and as such they must protect their product. This is completely reasonable in my opinion. But when that tool is used to conduct research, and reproducibility is a valuable characteristic of research, its proprietary nature is in conflict with the goal of reproducibility.\nLess than an hour ago, a colleague shared an article published on R bloggers which touched on some important questions I have considered when it comes to reproducible MATLAB.\nThe article makes the point that for proprietary languages such as MATLAB (as well as others such as Stata or SAS), reproducibility is fundamentally hindered. I couldn‚Äôt agree more! Which, as the author of a blog called ‚ÄúReproducible MATLAB‚Äù, may come as a surprise. Let me explain.\nFirstly, let‚Äôs clear up a technical question. One potential limitation of proprietary software described in the article is potential for limited availability of previous versions of the software used to generate a result. In the case of MATLAB, as it turns out (I had to go and check), you can download many (if not all) previous versions going back to R11.1, released in 1999. 1\nThen I think that things get a bit more philosophical and we have to consider how hard our definition of reproducibility is. Arguably, this definition could be completely binary: an analysis is either completely reproducible, or it‚Äôs not reproducible. This is probably the only sensible definition of reproducibility in research, but it puts some possibly unrealistic expectations on researchers who are, for the most part, just trying their best.\nWhen it comes to proprietary software like MATLAB, my view is that it‚Äôs not possible to produce an idealistically reproducible piece of research using this tool. Since it puts a requirement on the end user to have access to a costly piece of software, which they may not, and if they don‚Äôt then they can‚Äôt reproduce the original work.\nHowever: if a researcher has already produced some research using MATLAB, my stance is that it is fundamentally an improvement to make that research as reproducible as they can, rather than the alternative, which tends to be not making it reproducible at all.\nSo I suppose my preference would be for reseachers to conduct research in entirely open source tooling, but if they‚Äôre already using something proprietary then the pressures of the research world make it very unlikely that they will translate the work into an entirely OSS project. Therefore, it‚Äôs preferable to make something nearly reproducible, using a proprietary tool, if absolutely necessary."
